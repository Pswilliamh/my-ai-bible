Develpoed by The Spiritual Sciences Kingdom Of Heaven Consortium

Thank you for your interest in My AI Bible App and webportal 
There are three moduales to complete the project
The My AI Bible, The My AI Symphony Bible, and The My AI Flower Of Life AI Bible

Vision for project: Understanding the Vision
Mission statement, This is a tool that goes beyond traditional Bible study by incorporating:
- Strongs Concordance and Word Definitions: A robust search feature for in-depth word studies.
- Numerical Value of Each Word: Likely referring to systems like gematria, where words are assigned numerical values (e.g., Hebrew or Greek numerology).
- Electromagnetic Frequency Patterns: Mapping words or texts to vibrational frequencies, possibly tied to their spiritual or energetic resonance.
- Musical Notes and the "Music Spectrum": Assigning musical notes to words or texts, potentially based on their frequencies, and connecting this to a broader musical framework 
- AI Symphony Bible: The ultimate goal is to generate a symphony or musical composition based on scriptural texts, using the data from numerical values, frequencies, and musical notes.

This tool is meant to be a gateway for seekers, scholars, and Kingdom ambassadors to access transcendent knowledge, activating transformation and divine resonance. 
Itâ€™s a bold and interdisciplinary project, blending biblical scholarship, numerology, vibrational science, music theory, and AI.
This vision is for creating an AI-powered Bible program that serves as a higher-learning academic tool, specifically for curriculum development. 
The mission is ambitious and deeply rooted in blending spiritual, vibrational, and academic insights.
